# A Customizable, Colorful Progress Bar!

So i was searching for a way to create a progress bar, and stumbled upon [alive-progress](https://pypi.org/project/alive-progress/)!

They have a lot of spinners and bars!

If you want to see them, do this:
```py
from alive_progress import show_bars(), show_spinners()
show_bars()
# Or if you want to see the spinners:
show_spinners()
```

And if you would like to see an explanation of the code, please go [here](https://replit.com/talk/learn/A-Progress-Bar/142015)

Hope you enjoy and fell free to use it! (It isn't my project; it's a module, so I can't force you to credit me, unless you use the code from main.py in this [repl](https://replit.com/@CodingEssence/alive-progress#main.py), but you don't have to if you use the [tutorial](https://replit.com/talk/learn/A-Progress-Bar/142015))

## Hope you find this useful
